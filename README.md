# MiniCompiler - Arithmetic Compiler Visualizer

## 🚀 Overview

**MiniCompiler** is a GUI-based desktop application designed as a **PBL (Project-Based Learning) project** to visualize the various stages of the compilation process for arithmetic expressions.

The application allows users to input a mathematical expression and see its transformation into a Parse Tree, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Three-Address Code (TAC), Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and final Assembly Code, along with tokenization and evaluation.

## ✨ Features

The application provides a complete visualization pipeline for arithmetic expressions:

* **GUI Interface:** Built using Java Swing, featuring a main window titled "Arithmetic Compiler Visualizer".
* **Input & Tokenization:** Accepts an arithmetic expression and displays its corresponding tokens, including: `INT` (Integer), `FLOAT` (Float), `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(` (Left Parenthesis), and `)` (Right Parenthesis).
* **Evaluation:** Shows the final computed result of the expression.
* **Parse Tree Visualization:** Displays the full Parse Tree generated by the parser (likely ANTLR4, given the import references).
* **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Visualization:** Displays the Abstract Syntax Tree, which represents the essential structure of the code.
* **Three-Address Code (TAC):** Generates and displays the intermediate Three-Address Code.
* **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Visualization:** Visualizes the DAG representation, which is an optimization step for the TAC.
* **Assembly Code Generation:** Outputs simple, corresponding Assembly Code based on the TAC.
* **OCR Integration:** Includes a **"Load Image"** feature for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), suggesting the capability to process an image and extract an expression for analysis (requires Tesseract integration).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Dependencies

This project is primarily built with:

* **Java (Swing):** For the graphical user interface components.
* **ANTLR v4:** Likely used for parsing and building the initial parse tree (inferred from `org/antlr/v4/runtime/tree/ParseTree` references).
* **Tesseract/Tess4J:** Used for the OCR functionality to extract expressions from images (inferred from `net/sourceforge/tess4j/Tesseract` references).

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer.
* If using the OCR feature, you may need to install the **Tesseract OCR engine** and set up the TESSDATA path.

### Running the Application

Since this project consists of compiled Java classes, you would typically run it using a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd MiniCompiler/ArithmeticCompilerVisualizer
    ```
2.  **Compile and Run (Standard Java Application):**
    * *If source code was available:* Compile the project.
    * *If running the provided classes:* Execute the main class (`Main.class` or `App.class`) from the compiled directory structure.
    ```bash
    java com.vinay.ArithmeticCompilerVisualizer.App
    ```

## 💻 Usage

1.  **Start:** The application opens with a **Welcome Panel**. Click **"Continue to Compiler"** to proceed to the main interface.
2.  **Input:** Enter an arithmetic expression (e.g., `(a + 5) * 3`) into the "Enter Expression" text field.
3.  **Analyze:** Click the **"Analyze"** button.
4.  **View Results:** The application will populate the various panels:
    * **Tokens/Result:** Shows the token stream and final expression evaluation.
    * **TAC:** Displays the generated Three-Address Code.
    * **ASM:** Displays the generated Assembly Code.
    * **Parse Tree, Syntax Tree (AST), and DAG:** View the graphical representations through the tabbed pane.
5.  **OCR (Optional):** Click **"Load Image"** to select an image file containing a mathematical expression for automatic processing.
